I have set up this repo to house scripts to make changes to Ubuntu 16.04 based on my needs.
Being that I am currently toying around with a lot of binary, some of the things I have made this script do are:

Install radare2 from the github page,
Install peda from the github page,
Install python2 and python3,
Install pip, python requests, ROPgadget, and pwntools using pip,
Install zsh - because it's sexy and we know that is important,
Install some stuff needed to make zsh's agnoster theme work (in the future it will auto switch but for now it is manual),
and some other stuff.

You can simply read the scripts first if you don't trust them. I don't guarantee it works with every version of Ubuntu however, as I am only really trying it out at all on 16.04 LTS (64-bit beta, x86). Feel free to add other scripts to do stuff for the Ubuntu configuration.

I will update this as I do more.
